This directory contains all the source files used in the book. 
The compile_all_user.sh script compiles everything.

The kutrace_control.cc program is used to create traces, while other programs
are used to postprocess those traces into HTML display files. The postproc3.sh
script takes a tracefile stem (no ".trace") and produces the corresponding JSON
and HTML files.

Yet other programs are part of the book content or are used in the exercises.

All the code is open sourced under the BSD three-clause license.
