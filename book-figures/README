This directory contains HTML files for all the complex figures in the book.
Most are KUtrace timelines, but some are disk or RPC timelines.

For the KUtrace timelines, click on the figure number button(s) at the lower
left to pan and zoom to the corresponding timespan and display options. In a
few of the diagrams you will also need to hit <CR> in the pre-populated search 
box to show the hits. 

For the disk and RPC timelines, you will need to drag and mousewheel zoom 
yourself to get to the right timespan and vertical position. For most of the RPC
timelines, chick the Method button once to get the Server display colors. Also
use the Rel0 button as appropriate to line up all RPCs at the left.

Note that figure 7.3 is in a chapter 6 file and 24.6 in a chapter 23 file.

Once you reach a display corresponding to a book static picture, you can pan 
and zoom around to see more or less of the surrounding context and use the 
display buttons to add or subtract detail.
